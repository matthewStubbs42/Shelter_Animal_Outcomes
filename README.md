# Shelter_Animal_Outcomes
MultiLabel Classification: Predicting Shelter Animal Outcomes (Kaggle)

## Description

Using dataset from past Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data

The goal of this project is to try to predict animal outcomes (adoption, transfer, return to owner, etc.) based on the animals' individual attributes (age, sex, species, etc).

1. EDA: visualization of the dataset to understand distributions, trends and correlations. Also try to answer the question: which features are most important in determining animal outcomes?
2: Encode categoric variables, deal with null values, and prepare dataset for training
3: Applying machine learning classifiers to the dataset (XGBoost and Naive Bayes)
